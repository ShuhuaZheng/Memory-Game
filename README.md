## How The Game Works 
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

## Instructions
* Click on one card to flip over it to reveal its underlying symbol 
* Turn over a second card to find the corresponding card with the same symbol 
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
